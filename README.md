Heres my approach

I would use following AWS services to host thi sstatic website
- Amazon S3: Store static HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files. S3 is highly durable and available, and it integrates well with other AWS services.
- Amazon CloudFront: Use as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to cache and deliver the static content closer to the users, which decreases latency and increases the speed of content delivery.
- AWS Certificate Manager (ACM): Provides a way to manage SSL/TLS certificates for your domain, including renewal and deployment, at no additional cost.
- Amazon Route 53: Manage DNS and connect domain names with your CloudFront distributions.
- AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall): Protect the application from common web exploits and bots that might affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.
- AWS Lambda@Edge: (optional) To run server-side code closer to the user which can help with tasks like URL rewrites, security headers, or other edge computations without managing servers.
- IAM Policies: Restrict access to the S3 buckets and other resources using fine-grained IAM policies
- Logging and Monitoring: Use AWS CloudTrail and Amazon CloudWatch to log and monitor all access and requests to the resources.
I will make this website secure by following
- HTTPS: Use ACM for handling SSL/TLS certificates which are then used with CloudFront to serve content over HTTPS.
- Security Headers: Implement security headers using Lambda@Edge to add headers like Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.
For configuring AWS services, i will use Terraform.
